IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dashboard
Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.
It demonstrates how to use Python, SQL, and data visualization libraries to generate actionable business insights and a multi-panel dashboard.

Features
SQL-powered analytics using SQLite and pandas

Interactive, multi-panel dashboard with matplotlib and seaborn

Key HR insights: attrition by department and job role, income and age analysis, and more

Easy to extend for further analysis or integration with BI tools

Dataset
Source: Kaggle - IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance

File: WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv

Setup Instructions
Clone or download this repository.

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv in your project directory.

Install required Python packages (preferably in a virtual environment):

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
(No need to install sqlite3; it’s included with Python.)

Run the dashboard script in Jupyter Notebook or as a Python script.

Usage
Open dashboard.ipynb (or your Python script) in Jupyter or VS Code.

Run all cells/lines.
The dashboard will be generated with key charts:

Attrition count

Attrition rate by department

Average monthly income by attrition

Attrition rate by job role

Average age by attrition
